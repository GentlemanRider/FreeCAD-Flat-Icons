# Prerequisites

- Latest dev version from the FreeCAD repository (link)
- Opendark Preference pack (installs from addon manager) (link)
- Icon Themes Add-on (installs from addon manager) (link)
- Inkscape 1.3 (other versions will do the job, but this guide refers to this particular version)

## Inkscape preferences
### Document settings
Page settings for a new file from scratch (not recommended)

### CSS handling during copy / paste
By default, Inkscape replicates the class style into pasted elements. This needs to be clean afterwards and it's a pain. Selecting this option disables this behavior and makes working with CSS way easier.

### Path inset / outset size
This is required for easy handling of the outer strokes.
